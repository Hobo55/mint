## Some apt commands

*** Debian Notes  **********************

# Package commands

* sudo apt update  - update pkg database

* sudo apt upgrade - upgrade installed pkgs

    do both by :
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

* sudo apt full-upgrade - will remove uneeded pkgs

* do not upgrade a specific pkg
sudo apt install <package_name> --no-upgrade

* sudo apt remove <package_name> - remove pkg
  Another way of uninstalling packages is to use purge.
   The command is used in the following manner:
* sudo apt purge <package_name> - removes conf files
* sudo apt autoremove - cleanup pkg orphans

* apt search <search term> - search for pkg
  regex: ex- v.\* OR n\* 

* apt show <package_name> - show contents of pkg

* apt list --upgradeable - show pkgs ready for upgrade
* apt list --installed   - show all pkgs on ur sys
* apt list --all-versions - all pkgs available for ur sys
- sudo apt list --installed # list installed pkgs
  "    "   "          "     | grep <pkg name>
- sudo dpkg-query -l | less # list pkgs (older)
apt-cache show, apt-cache search <keyword>
 apt-cache pkgnames #list all avail pkgs in repos
 "     ""    "     <pkgname> # single pkg

# older versions: list pkgs to a file
- sudo dpkg-query -f '${binary:Package}\n' -W > pkgs-list.txt
   "     "   "       "         "         " -W | wc -l # num/pkgs

# u can install list from file to new server/distro by:
- sudo xargs -a <file name> apt install

* apt edit-sources   -edit source.list files

* You can add repo for backport :
 sudo apt-get install -t buster-backports <packagename>

# FOR SCRIPTS: use 
apt-get install, etc

# Currently the apt binary supports the following commands:

apt:

 list: 
 which is similar to dpkg list and can be used with flags like
   --installed or --upgradable.

 search:
  works just like apt-cache search but sorted alphabetically.

 show:
  works like apt-cache show but hide some details that people are
  less likely to care about (like the hashes). The full record is still
  available via apt-cache show of course.

 update:
  like the regular apt-get update with color output enabled, but
  apt update also shows the number of upgradeable packages (if any).

 install,remove:
  adds progress output during the dpkg run.

 upgrade:
  the same as apt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs.*

 full-upgrade:
  a more meaningful name for dist-upgrade.

 edit-sources:
  edit sources.list using $EDITOR.

 policy:
  works just like apt-cache policy

# You can enable/disable the install progress [bar] via:
 echo 'Dpkg::Progress-Fancy "1";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99progressbar
